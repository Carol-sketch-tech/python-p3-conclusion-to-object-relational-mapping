Objectives have been 
    1. creating python objects using SQL databse records
    2. creating databse records using python objects.

Benefits of ORMs are :
    1. Create tables in a corresponding python class.
    2. Insert data into the database froma  python method.
    3. Find and update existing database records when chagens are made totheir related oython objects.
    4. We can map a databasetable to a python object as well as we can make python objects from databse rows.
    with our ORM in place, other developers can leverage the prower of SQL in our python calss without needing to write it themselves.
